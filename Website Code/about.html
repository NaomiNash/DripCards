  <h2>Your fashion<span style="color: goldenrod;"> ACE</span> up your sleeve</h2>
  <p>The purpose of DripCards is to allow users to plan their outfits for the week without touching their closet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By uploading their clothing pieces into the website, these turn into “Drip Cards” which then can be combined into 
  <br/> “Outfit Cards” as they plan their outfits for the day, week, or any occasion. 
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The “Drip Cards” combine into a “Deck of Cards” which represent the user’s closet.
  <br/>
  <h3>The creaters of DripCards are <span style="color: goldenrod;">Naomi Nash</span> and <span style="color: goldenrod;">Daria Pacheco</span></h3>
