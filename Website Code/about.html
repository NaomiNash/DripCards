<h2 style="color: black; text-align:center;">Drip Cards: Your fashion<span style="color: goldenrod;"> ACE</span> up your sleeve</h2>
  <p style="text-align:center;">The purpose of Drip Cards is to allow users to plan their outfits for the week without touching their closet.
  <br/>
  By uploading their clothing pieces into the website, these turn into “Drip Cards” which then can be combined into “Outfit Cards” as they plan their outfits for the day, week, or any occasion. 
  <br/>
  The “Drip Cards” combine into a “Deck of Cards” which represent the user’s closet.
  <br/>
  <h3 style="text-align:center;">The creaters of Drip Cards are <span style="color: goldenrod;">Naomi Nash</span> and <span style="color: goldenrod;">Daria Pacheco</span></h3>
