<h2>Drip Cards: Your fashion<span style="color: goldenrod;"> ACE</span> up your sleeve</h2>
<p>The purpose of Drip Cards is to allow users to plan their outfits for the week without touching their closet.
<br/>
<br/>
By uploading their clothing pieces into the website, these turn into “Drip Cards” which then can be combined into 
<br/> “Outfit Cards” as they plan their outfits for the day, week, or any occasion. 
<br/>
<br/>
The “Drip Cards” combine into a “Deck of Cards” which represent the user’s closet.
<br/>
<h3>The creaters of Drip Cards are <span style="color: goldenrod;">Naomi Nash</span> and <span style="color: goldenrod;">Daria Pacheco</span></h3>
