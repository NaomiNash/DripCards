# DripCards
DripCards is a project that Daria Pacheco and Naomi Nash have been developing for Saint Leo's Software Development course. 
It will be a website application that allows users to upload photos of the clothes in their closet and plan ahead for outfits,
  discover what clothes they do not wear as often anymore, and find clothes and styles that others wear that they want to
  replicate.
